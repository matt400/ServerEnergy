# ServerEnergy

It's a first simple program for learning C#. The purpose of this program is to save energy data from Tasmota metric to database and calculate cost with proper rate.

This is an experimental program which I'm using in my docker image. I'm aware of the bad design decisions I've made, this could be done much better.

Right now I'm writing the same program, but in [Kotlin](https://github.com/matt400/ServerEnergyKt).
